I got these mainly because I got an eero router, and these could act as end points for the mesh Wi-Fi system I wanted. I will say that the Amazon services integration for the most part is good. But I don't like the fact that AMZN seems to try and nickle and dime you for everything. I got a blink camera with one of my dots and it is essentially useless because I can't hook it up to my personal cloud - or at least I can't do it easily. Same thing with my garage door opener and its camera. Unless I upgrade to a cloud storage service offered by AMZN or the device, the integration between those devices is pretty worthless. But I didn't get them for that, hence the ratings. If I had gotten them for those things, then the rating would be lower. For now, I'll just do it the old fashioned way.",

Other than that, which is more than likely just because of my hearing issues - my only issue is that I was using Apple Music Plus and the lack of music controls (Queuing music, selecting specific songs without verbal command, etc) is literally nonexistent. Since I get Apple Music for free, I decided to get a Spotify Premium subscription because I like to be picky when listening to my music. Every so often, if I try to connect the dot through the Spotify app, it will show that the dot is unavailable so it\u2019s a bit frustrating but not the end of the world. It\u2019s still worth the purchase though!",
